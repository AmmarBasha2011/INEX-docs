# Use ""

In the Ahmed Template of the INEX SPA PHP Framework, it is recommended to use double quotes (`""`) with the `Use` directive. While this is not mandatory for all items, it is required for the following three directives:​

* `@set("", )`
* `@define("", )`
* `@var("")`​

**Explanation:**

* **Use of Double Quotes:** In many templating systems, including those in PHP frameworks, using double quotes ensures that strings are correctly interpreted, especially when variables or expressions are involved.
* **Specific Directives:** The directives `@set`, `@define`, and `@var` likely require double quotes to properly parse the provided values or expressions.​

**Additional Note:**

If you're encountering issues or errors without using double quotes in these directives, it's advisable to consult the official documentation of the INEX SPA PHP Framework or reach out to the community forums for specific guidance.
