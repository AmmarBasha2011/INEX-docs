# Additional Notes

* Route files should use consistent suffix naming (\_dynamic, \_request\_GET, etc)
* Cache keys should be descriptive and namespaced to avoid conflicts
* Use environment variables for configuration instead of hardcoding values
* Keep framework core files unchanged to ensure smooth updates
* Test thoroughly on development before deploying to production
* Monitor cache usage to prevent memory issues
* Document any custom implementations or modifications
* Follow PHP best practices and coding standards
* Keep backups of critical application data
* Use version control for tracking changes
