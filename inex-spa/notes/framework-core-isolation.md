# Framework Core Isolation

The framework core is designed to be self-contained and automatically managed. To maintain stability:

* Never manually include framework core files
* Don't modify the core loading sequence
* Let the framework handle all core dependencies
* Core functionality is initialized in the correct order
* Framework bootstrapping is handled automatically
* Prevents version conflicts and inconsistencies

This ensures reliable operation and makes upgrades smoother while reducing potential errors from manual file management.
