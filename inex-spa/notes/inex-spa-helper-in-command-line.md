# INEX SPA Helper in Command Line

You can use INEX SPA Helper both in code and through the command line interface. This functionality is powered by Google's Gemini AI model. Note that you'll need valid Gemini API credentials to use this feature. While the command line version offers helpful assistance, the quality and capabilities may differ from the online INEX SPA Helper available at udify.app.
