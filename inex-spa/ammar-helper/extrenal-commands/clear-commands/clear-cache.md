# clear:cache

To efficiently manage your project's cache within the INEX SPA PHP Framework, you can remove all cache files stored in the `cache` folder by executing the following command:

```bash
php ammar clear:cache
```

This command is a helpful utility for freeing up disk space and ensuring that cached files are consistently up-to-date. Regularly clearing the cache can improve performance during development by ensuring that all recent changes are applied effectively without being hindered by outdated or corrupted cache files.
