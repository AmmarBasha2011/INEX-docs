# Route Type Restrictions

The framework enforces strict route typing:

* Dynamic routes cannot also be request-type routes
* Each route must have one clear purpose
* Mixed route types are not supported
* Maintains routing consistency
* Ensures predictable behavior
* Required for security policy compliance
* Helps prevent routing conflicts

Following these guidelines ensures:

* Better application stability
* Improved security
* Consistent behavior
* Easier maintenance
* Better performance
