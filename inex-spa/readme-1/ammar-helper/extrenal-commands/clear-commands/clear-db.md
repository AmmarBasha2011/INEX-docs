# clear:db

To clear all files in the `db` folder before migrating or after, you can use a single line command provided by the PHP script. Simply execute `php ammar clear:db` in your terminal. This command efficiently removes all existing database files, preparing the environment for a fresh migration. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions and have backed up any necessary data.
