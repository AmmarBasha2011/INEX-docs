# "Use Cookie, Server Less"

> "Use Cookie, Server Less"

The quote **"Use Cookie, Server Less"** represents a technique where:

* **Cookies store essential data**, reducing reliance on backend servers.
* The **server does minimal processing**, or in some cases, is not needed at all.
* Authentication, session management, and even small data exchanges happen **entirely on the client side**.

#### **Why is this useful?**

* Reduces **server load**, improving performance.
* Enables **stateless interactions**, making scaling easier.
* Enhances **speed and efficiency** by minimizing backend dependencies.

This approach is ideal for **lightweight web applications, progressive web apps (PWAs), and edge computing** where reducing server interaction improves responsiveness. 🚀🍪
